The Rabbit and the turtle
Once upon a time, there lived a rabbit and a turtle who were fighting to see who was the faster runner. 
The rabbit thought that it was a great runner while the turtle thought it was. So, the fox suggested them to compete in a race to find out
the answer. 
Turtle was very fast. Rabbit was very slow. 
Turtle thought of himself very highly.
